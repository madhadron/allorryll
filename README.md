Simplus is a JavaScript user interface framework. It achieves a high degree of simplicity by eschewing hard coded HTML and generating the whole DOM in JavaScript with clean MVC. There is no magic anywhere in the framework.

Simplus makes no attempt to be backwards compatible. It uses grid-layout and flexbox for all its layout.
