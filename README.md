allorryll 0.1 - A library for simple, if unfamiliar, web application construction

Primary author:

allorryll is a framework for writing web applications. It eschews all hard coded
HTML in favor of pure JavaScript implementing an MVC architecture much like
you would find in a desktop application. The approach is unfamiliar, but simple
and fast once you adjust. There is no magic and no complicated machinery.

allorryll makes no attempt to be backwards compatible. It uses grad-layout
and flexbox freely. There is no attempt to construct interfaces from
carefully placed divs, nor to work around quirks in old versions of Internet
Explorer.

Where did the name come from?
-----------------------------

"Allo-" is a prefix from ancient Greek meaning "other" or "different." "Rryll"
is an archaic word derived from Welsh for a small stream. You could take that
to mean a different approach to web application development. You would be wrong,
though. I made up the word first while looking for something with no Google
results, and realized it had sensible structure afterwards.
